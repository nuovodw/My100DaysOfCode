### Day 1: December 27, 2020
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Continued with Angela Yu's 2020 Web Dev Bootcamp + Coding Challenges</br>
    1. [FizzBuzz challenge (No Loop)](https://github.com/nuovodw/My100DaysOfCode/blob/main/Code%20Practice/FizzBuzz_No_ForLoop.js)
    1. [Who's Paying code (Math.random, Math.floor)](https://github.com/nuovodw/My100DaysOfCode/blob/main/Code%20Practice/Who_Is_Paying.js)
    1. [Leap Year Calculator (Modulo)](https://github.com/nuovodw/My100DaysOfCode/blob/main/Code%20Practice/Leap_Year_Calculator.js)
    1. [FizzBuzz (with While Loop)](https://github.com/nuovodw/My100DaysOfCode/blob/main/Code%20Practice/FizzBuzz_While_Loop.js)
    1. [99 Bottles on the Wall (While Loop)](https://github.com/nuovodw/My100DaysOfCode/blob/main/Code%20Practice/99_Bottles.js)
    1. [FizzBuzz (with For Loop)](https://github.com/nuovodw/My100DaysOfCode/blob/main/Code%20Practice/FizzBuzz_For_Loop.js)

**Thoughts:**</br> 
1. The FizzBuzz challenge took forever, at least 3-4 hours, but I was ecstatic to have solved it without watching the solution.</br> 
1. The Who's Paying code, compared to the FizzBuzz, was relatively simple.
1. I need to divide my time, so I can continue to learn JavaScript while reviewing/practicing HTML/CSS.

**Short-term plan:**</br> 
1. Finish Angela Yu's JavaScript up to the Intermediate section.
1. Start Andrei Neagoie's JavaScript and study through the Intermediate section.
1. Start Angela Yu's CSS

### Day 2: December 28, 2020
**Today's Progress**: 
1. Started working on the Fibonacci sequence challenge.
1. (3 hours later) I solved it!!
    1. [Fibonacci Generator](https://github.com/nuovodw/My100DaysOfCode/blob/main/Code%20Practice/fibonacci_generator.js)
1. Finished Angela Yu's JavaScript module through the intermediate level.

**Thoughts:**</br> 
1. ~~I've been working on it for about 2 hours now; it seems like I'm about half way there.~~
1. ~~Perhaps it's a little over my head, but I'll give another crack at it after a break.~~
1. It took many hours of staring at the monitor and trying so many different codes, but, at last, I solved it! Probably not the most DRY code for this challenge, but I'm proud to have completed the challenge.

**Short-term plan:**</br> 
1. Finish the Fibonacci challenge by the end of the day!
1. Revisit CSS, as I haven't done it in a few days.
</br>

### Day 3: December 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Started Andrei Neagoie's JavaScript modules (from Web Dev: Zero to Mastery).
    1. Completed through about half of the beginning/intermediate level.
    1. Finished 5 coding challenges.

**Thoughts:**</br> 
1. I consider Jonas Schmedtmann's Complete JavaScript Course 2021 as my main guide for JavaScript.
    1. I recently completed all modules and coding challenges through the intermediate level (Fundamentals Part I/II).
1. I decided to review my JavaScript knowledge and coding skills with Angela Yu's and Adrei N.'s bootcamp courses, because:
    1. I wanted to make sure that my JS foundation was solid before moving on to Schmedtmann's advanced modules.
    2. Yu's and Neagoie's JS modules are relatively short.
    3. I'm glad I chose this path.

**Short-term plan:**</br> 
1. Finish Neagoie's JS through the intermediate level in the next couple of days.
1. Jump into Schmedtmann's advanced JS lectures.
    1. I'm looking forward to learning DOM manipulation.

### Day 4: December 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Continued with Neogoie's JavaScript modules.
2. Took a break from JS for a little bit and followed along Carla-Codes's Youtube video of Starry Night CSS Animation.

**Thoughts:**</br> 
1. It's interesting and helpful to hear different instructors explain javaScript. 
    1. I'm picking up things I missed from the first two instructors; I'm glad to be reviewing the intermediate JS.
2. Tried CSS animation for the first time today--WOW!
    1. I only understood half of the program but it was nice to see what's possible with CSS--and to take a break from JS for a little bit.

**Short-term plan:**</br> 
1. Finish Neagoie's JS through the intermediate level tomorrow.
1. Jump into Schmedtmann's advanced JS lectures.
    1. I'm looking forward to learning DOM manipulation.
