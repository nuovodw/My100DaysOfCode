# My 100 Days of Code
## Coding diary to track my progress

### Day 1: December 27, 2020
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Continued with Angela Yu's 2020 Web Dev Bootcamp </br>
    1. FizzBuzz challenge
    1. Who's Paying code
    1. Leap Year Calculator

**Thoughts:**</br> 
1. The FizzBuzz challenge took forever, at least 3-4 hours, but I was ecstatic to have solved it without watching the solution.</br> 
1. The Who's Paying code, compared to the FizzBuzz, was relatively simple.
1. I need to divide my time, so I can continue to learn JavaScript while reviewing/practicing HTML/CSS.

**Short-term plan:**</br> 
1. Finish Angela Yu's JavaScript up to the Intermediate section.
1. Start Andrei Neagoie's JavaScript and study through the Intermediate section.
1. Start Angela Yu's CSS

### Day 1: June 27, Monday
**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
