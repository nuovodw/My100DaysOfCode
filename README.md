# My 100 Days of Code
## Coding diary to track my progress

### Day 1: December 27, 2020
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Continued with Angela Yu's 2020 Web Dev Bootcamp + Coding Challenges</br>
    1. FizzBuzz challenge (No Loop)
    1. Who's Paying code (Math.random, Math.floor)
    1. Leap Year Calculator (Modulo)
    1. FizzBuzz (with While Loop)
    1. 99 Bottles on the Wall (While Loop)
    1. FizzBuzz (with For Loop)

**Thoughts:**</br> 
1. The FizzBuzz challenge took forever, at least 3-4 hours, but I was ecstatic to have solved it without watching the solution.</br> 
1. The Who's Paying code, compared to the FizzBuzz, was relatively simple.
1. I need to divide my time, so I can continue to learn JavaScript while reviewing/practicing HTML/CSS.

**Short-term plan:**</br> 
1. Finish Angela Yu's JavaScript up to the Intermediate section.
1. Start Andrei Neagoie's JavaScript and study through the Intermediate section.
1. Start Angela Yu's CSS

### Day 2: December 28, 2020
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Started working on the Fibonacci sequence challenge.
1. (3 hours later) I solved it!!
    1. Code Practice/fibonacci_generator.js

**Thoughts:**</br> 
1. ~~I've been working on it for about 2 hours now; it seems like I'm about half way there.~~
1. ~~Perhaps it's a little over my head, but I'll give another crack at it after a break.~~
1. It took many hours of staring at the monitor and trying so many different codes, but, at last, I solved it! Probably not the most DRY code for this challenge, but I'm proud to have completed the challenge.

**Short-term plan:**</br> 
1. Finish the Fibonacci challenge by the end of the day!
1. Revisit CSS, as I haven't done it in a few days.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday
**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
