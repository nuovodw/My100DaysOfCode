# My 100 Days of Code
## Coding diary to track my progress

### Day 1: December 27, 2020
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Continued with Angela Yu's 2020 Web Dev Bootcamp + Coding Challenges</br>
    1. [FizzBuzz challenge (No Loop)](https://github.com/nuovodw/My100DaysOfCode/blob/main/Code%20Practice/FizzBuzz_No_ForLoop.js)
    1. [Who's Paying code (Math.random, Math.floor)](https://github.com/nuovodw/My100DaysOfCode/blob/main/Code%20Practice/Who_Is_Paying.js)
    1. [Leap Year Calculator (Modulo)](https://github.com/nuovodw/My100DaysOfCode/blob/main/Code%20Practice/Leap_Year_Calculator.js)
    1. [FizzBuzz (with While Loop)](https://github.com/nuovodw/My100DaysOfCode/blob/main/Code%20Practice/FizzBuzz_While_Loop.js)
    1. [99 Bottles on the Wall (While Loop)](https://github.com/nuovodw/My100DaysOfCode/blob/main/Code%20Practice/99_Bottles.js)
    1. [FizzBuzz (with For Loop)](https://github.com/nuovodw/My100DaysOfCode/blob/main/Code%20Practice/FizzBuzz_For_Loop.js)

**Thoughts:**</br> 
1. The FizzBuzz challenge took forever, at least 3-4 hours, but I was ecstatic to have solved it without watching the solution.</br> 
1. The Who's Paying code, compared to the FizzBuzz, was relatively simple.
1. I need to divide my time, so I can continue to learn JavaScript while reviewing/practicing HTML/CSS.

**Short-term plan:**</br> 
1. Finish Angela Yu's JavaScript up to the Intermediate section.
1. Start Andrei Neagoie's JavaScript and study through the Intermediate section.
1. Start Angela Yu's CSS

</br>

### Day 2: December 28, 2020
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Started working on the Fibonacci sequence challenge.
1. (3 hours later) I solved it!!
    1. [Fibonacci Generator](https://github.com/nuovodw/My100DaysOfCode/blob/main/Code%20Practice/fibonacci_generator.js)
1. Finished Angela Yu's JavaScript module through the intermediate level.

**Thoughts:**</br> 
1. ~~I've been working on it for about 2 hours now; it seems like I'm about half way there.~~
1. ~~Perhaps it's a little over my head, but I'll give another crack at it after a break.~~
1. It took many hours of staring at the monitor and trying so many different codes, but, at last, I solved it! Probably not the most DRY code for this challenge, but I'm proud to have completed the challenge.

**Short-term plan:**</br> 
1. Finish the Fibonacci challenge by the end of the day!
1. Revisit CSS, as I haven't done it in a few days.

### Day 3: December 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Started Andrei Neagoie's JavaScript modules (from Web Dev: Zero to Mastery).
    1. Completed through about half of the beginning/intermediate level.
    1. Finished 5 coding challenges.

**Thoughts:**</br> 
1. I consider Jonas Schmedtmann's Complete JavaScript Course 2021 as my main guide for JavaScript.
    1. I recently completed all modules and coding challenges through the intermediate level (Fundamentals Part I/II).
1. I decided to review my JavaScript knowledge and coding skills with Angela Yu's and Adrei N.'s bootcamp courses, because:
    1. I wanted to make sure that my JS foundation was solid before moving on to Schmedtmann's advanced modules.
    2. Yu's and Neagoie's JS modules are relatively short.
    3. I'm glad I chose this path.

**Short-term plan:**</br> 
1. Finish Neagoie's JS through the intermediate level in the next couple of days.
1. Jump into Schmedtmann's advanced JS lectures.
    1. I'm looking forward to learning DOM manipulation.
1. Revisit CSS, as I haven't done it in a few days.


</br>
</br>

### Day 4: December 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Continued with Neogoie's JavaScript modules.
2. Took a break from JS for a little bit and followed along Carla-Codes's Youtube video of Starry Night CSS Animation.

**Thoughts:**</br> 
1. It's interesting and helpful to hear different instructors explain javaScript. 
    1. I'm picking up things I missed from the first two instructors; I'm glad to be reviewing the intermediate JS.
2. Tried CSS animation for the first time today--WOW!
    1. I only understood half of the program but it was nice to see what's possible with CSS--and to take a break from JS for a little bit.

**Short-term plan:**</br> 
1. Finish Neagoie's JS through the intermediate level tomorrow.
1. Jump into Schmedtmann's advanced JS lectures.
    1. I'm looking forward to learning DOM manipulation.
1. Revisit CSS, as I haven't done it in a few days.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday
**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

**Link(s) to work**
1. [Find the Longest Word in a String](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/find-the-longest-word-in-a-string)
